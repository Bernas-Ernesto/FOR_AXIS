          <h2>RA 10173 - Data Privacy Act</h2>
          <div class="sub">Purpose & Scope</div>
          <p>The Data Privacy Act of 2012 aims to protect the fundamental human right to privacy while ensuring free flow of information for innovation, growth, and national development. This act applies to both private and government sectors processing personal data. It also applies to some processing by entities outside the Philippines, if the data subject is a Filipino citizen/resident or some related connections exist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="principles">
          <h3 class="sub">Principles</h3>
          <p>The law requires all data processing activities to follow the principles of transparency, legitimate purpose, and proportionality. Personal data must be collected for lawful, specified reasons, kept accurate and up-to-date, and retained only as long as necessary. Consent is generally required, especially for sensitive personal information, unless exemptions are provided by law.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="rights">
          <h3 class="sub">Rights of Data Subjects</h3>
          <p>Individuals, referred to as data subjects, are given rights to control their personal data. These include the right to be informed about how their information is used, to object to certain processing activities, to access and correct inaccuracies, to request erasure or blocking, and to exercise data portability, which allows transfer of their data to another controller.</p>

          <p>Entities that process personal data must implement organizational, technical, and physical measures to protect information against loss, theft, or unauthorized use. In the event of a data breach, organizations are required to promptly notify the National Privacy Commission (NPC) and the affected individuals to minimize harm and ensure accountability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="enforcement">
          <h3 class="sub">Enforcement & Penalties</h3>
          <p>The NPC is an independent body tasked with enforcing the law, providing guidance, monitoring compliance, and handling complaints related to data privacy. It has the authority to investigate violations, issue orders, require registration of certain data processing systems, and impose administrative sanctions to ensure strict compliance.</p>

          <p>Certain types of data processing are exempt from full application of the law, such as information for journalistic or artistic purposes, research with adequate safeguards, law enforcement and regulatory functions, and public information on government officials. However, entities are still expected to uphold basic data security and respect essential privacy rights. Violations like unauthorized processing, negligence, improper disposal, or malicious disclosure of personal data are subject to penalties and possible imprisonment, and organizations and their officers are held accountable through required policies, documentation, and the appointment of compliance officers.</p>
