          <h2>WMA Declaration of Helsinki</h2>
          <div class="sub">Foundational Framework</div>
          <p>The WMA Declaration of Helsinki, originally adopted in 1964 and most recently amended in October 2024, establishes comprehensive ethical principles for medical research involving human participants, including research using identifiable human material or data. The Declaration applies to all individuals, teams, and organizations involved in medical research and must be read as a whole, with each paragraph considered in relation to all other relevant provisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="core-duty">
          <h3 class="sub">Core Duty and Purpose</h3>
          <p>Physicians and researchers bear the duty to promote and safeguard the health, well-being, and rights of patients and research participants. The primary purpose of medical research is to generate knowledge about disease causes, development, and effects; improve preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions; and advance individual and public health. However, these purposes can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research participants.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="protection">
          <h3 class="sub">Protection of Research Participants</h3>
          <p>Researchers must protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, autonomy, privacy, and confidentiality of research participants. The responsibility for protection always rests with physicians and researchers, never with participants themselves, even when consent has been given. Medical research must be conducted only by individuals with appropriate ethics and scientific education, training, and qualifications, requiring supervision by competent and appropriately qualified professionals. Scientific integrity is essential, and research misconduct is prohibited.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="comm-eng">
          <h3 class="sub">Community Engagement and Equity</h3>
          <p>Meaningful engagement with potential participants and their communities should occur before, during, and following research. Researchers should enable participants and communities to share their priorities and values, participate in research design and implementation, and engage in understanding and disseminating results. Groups underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation. Research must carefully consider how benefits, risks, and burdens are distributed within the context of various structural inequities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="other">
          <h3 class="sub">Risks, Vulnerability, and Research Requirements</h3>
          <p><strong>Risks, Burdens, and Benefits:</strong> Medical research may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to participants. All research must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to individuals and groups in comparison with foreseeable benefits. Measures to minimize risks and burdens must be implemented, with continuous monitoring, assessment, and documentation. Researchers must be confident that risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Research must be modified or stopped when risks outweigh potential benefits or when conclusive proof of definitive outcomes is obtained.</p>

          <p><strong>Vulnerability and Protection:</strong> Individuals, groups, and communities in situations of particular vulnerability require specifically considered support and protections. Research with vulnerable populations is justified only if responsive to their health needs and priorities, with the potential for direct benefit from resulting knowledge, practices, or interventions. Vulnerable participants should only be included when research cannot be conducted in less vulnerable groups or when exclusion would perpetuate or exacerbate disparities. The harms of exclusion must be weighed against the harms of inclusion.</p>

          <p><strong>Scientific Requirements & Protocols:</strong> Research must have scientifically sound and rigorous design and execution likely to produce reliable, valid, and valuable knowledge while avoiding research waste. The design and performance must be clearly described and justified in a research protocol containing statements of ethical considerations, how Declaration principles have been addressed, and comprehensive information regarding aims, methods, benefits, risks, researcher qualifications, funding sources, conflicts of interest, privacy protections, participant incentives, compensation provisions, and post-trial provisions for clinical trials.</p>

          <p><strong>Research Ethics Committees:</strong> Research protocols must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and approval to research ethics committees before research begins. Committees must be transparent, independent, adequately resourced, and composed of members with sufficient education, training, qualifications, and diversity to evaluate research effectively. Committees must include at least one general public member and have sufficient familiarity with local circumstances and context. For international collaborative research, protocols must be approved by ethics committees in both sponsoring and host countries. Committees retain the right to monitor, recommend changes to, withdraw approval for, and suspend ongoing research.</p>

          <p><strong>Free and Informed Consent, Placebo Use, Post-Trial Provisions:</strong> Free and informed consent is essential. New interventions should be tested against the best proven interventions except in limited circumstances. Sponsors and researchers must arrange post-trial provisions to provide continued access where needed. Research must be registered and results made public; funding and conflicts of interest must be disclosed; compensation and treatment for research-related harm should be ensured.</p>
