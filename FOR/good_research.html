          <h2>Good Research Practice</h2>
          <div class="sub">Transparency, Data Integrity, Pre-registration</div>
          <p>Good research practice emphasizes transparency, rigorous data integrity, and where appropriate, pre-registration of study designs and analysis plans to avoid selective reporting and research waste. These principles ensure that research findings are reproducible, trustworthy, and that conclusions drawn are supported by accurate records and documented methodology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="authorship">
          <h3 class="sub">Authorship and Publication Standards</h3>
          <p>Authorship must be merit-based and limited to individuals who have contributed significantly to conceptualization, design, execution, or interpretation of research. Honorary authorship is prohibited. Each coauthor bears responsibility for evaluating procedures, data, and conclusions within their area of expertise, with the submitting author coordinating manuscript review and ensuring all authors have approved the final publication.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="data">
          <h3 class="sub">Data Management and Documentation</h3>
          <p>Research data must be recorded in accessible formats for analysis and review, with immediate availability to collaborators, Principal Investigators, and supervisors. Records must contain sufficient detail to authenticate results, reproduce findings, and validate conclusions. Consistent data organization, descriptive file naming, and quality assurance are essential. Primary experimental results must be retained for three to seven years or longer, depending on funding source and research type.</p>

          <p><strong>Intellectual Property and Transitions:</strong> Institutions retain ownership of intellectual property developed using institutional funds or facilities under sponsored research agreements. When personnel transitions occur, departing Principal Investigators must inventory and transfer activities appropriately while ensuring institutions retain complete records. Students and postdoctoral researchers may take data copies only with Principal Investigator approval, with original data remaining at the institution.</p>

          <p><strong>Laboratory Notebooks:</strong> Disciplines utilizing laboratory notebooks must employ permanently bound books with consecutive, signed, and dated entries. Attachments require signatures, dates, and permanent affixing, with separate entries documenting the location of data that cannot be physically attached.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="mentorship">
          <h3 class="sub">Mentorship and Research Environment</h3>
          <p>Principal Investigators must communicate standards for scientific conduct, authorship policies, data management practices, and publication guidelines to students and postdoctoral researchers. Each student requires a designated primary mentor responsible for providing technical training, performance appraisals, and career guidance. Regular meetings to discuss research progress, data interpretation, and concerns are mandatory, with Principal Investigators maintaining direct contact with all research members.</p>

          <p><strong>Research Environment:</strong> Supervisors must cultivate environments promoting open discussion, methodological critique, and mutual respect. Principal Investigators should routinely review primary data from all research members, regardless of experience level, to maintain research integrity standards.</p>
