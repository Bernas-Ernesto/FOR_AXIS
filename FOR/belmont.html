          <h2>Belmont Report</h2>
          <div class="sub">Historical Context and Purpose</div>
          <p>The Belmont Report was established by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research following the National Research Act of 1974. Published in April 1979, it emerged from nearly four years of deliberations and addresses ethical issues arising from historical abuses, including Nazi concentration camp experiments and the Tuskegee syphilis study. The report distinguishes between research (designed to test hypotheses and develop generalizable knowledge) and medical practice (interventions designed to enhance individual well-being).</p>

        <div class="card" id="principles">
          <h3 class="sub">Three Core Ethical Principles</h3>
          <p><strong>1. Respect for Persons.</strong> This principle encompasses two fundamental convictions: treating individuals as autonomous agents capable of self-determination, and providing protection for persons with diminished autonomy. Autonomous individuals possess the capacity for deliberation about personal goals and acting upon such deliberation. Respect requires acknowledging their considered opinions and choices while refraining from obstructing their actions unless clearly detrimental to others. For individuals with diminished capacity—including minors, mentally disabled persons, or those severely restricted by circumstances—protection is required proportionate to the risk of harm and likelihood of benefit. This principle mandates that research subjects participate voluntarily with adequate information.</p>

          <p><strong>2. Beneficence.</strong> Beneficence obligates researchers not merely to respect decisions and protect from harm, but actively to secure subjects' well-being. This principle incorporates two complementary rules: (1) do not harm, and (2) maximize possible benefits while minimizing possible harms. The principle extends beyond individual investigators to society at large, requiring forethought regarding benefit maximization and risk reduction. Beneficence presents complex challenges when research involves more than minimal risk without immediate direct benefit, particularly with vulnerable populations such as children. The principle requires balancing the justification for seeking benefits against the risks involved.</p>

          <p><strong>3. Justice.</strong> Justice addresses fair distribution of research burdens and benefits, operating at both social and individual levels. The principle demands scrutiny of subject selection to prevent systematic exploitation of vulnerable populations—welfare patients, racial and ethnic minorities, or institutionalized persons—simply due to their availability, compromised position, or manipulability. Historical injustices demonstrate this concern: 19th and early 20th century research burdened poor ward patients while benefits flowed to private patients. Justice requires that publicly funded research yielding therapeutic advances not provide advantages exclusively to those with financial means, and that research should not disproportionately involve persons unlikely to benefit from subsequent applications.</p>

        <div class="card" id="applications">
          <h3 class="sub">Practical Applications</h3>
          <p><strong>Informed Consent.</strong> Derived from respect for persons, informed consent requires three elements: information, comprehension, and voluntariness. Information disclosure must include research procedures, purposes, risks, anticipated benefits, alternative procedures, and the right to withdraw. The standard should enable reasonable volunteers, understanding procedures are neither necessary for their care nor fully understood, to decide whether to participate. Comprehension requires adapting information presentation to subjects' capacities, with investigators responsible for verifying understanding. Voluntariness demands conditions free from coercion and undue influence, particularly when subjects are vulnerable or authorities exert commanding influence.</p>

          <p><strong>Risk-Benefit Assessment.</strong> Assessment requires systematic examination of all relevant data and alternative methods for obtaining sought benefits. Risk encompasses both probability and magnitude of potential harm (psychological, physical, legal, social, economic), while benefits refer to positive health or welfare outcomes. Assessment must consider effects on individual subjects, their families, and society. The process demands thorough, systematic, nonarbitrary analysis ensuring risks are reduced to those necessary for research objectives, with extraordinary justification required for significant risks of serious impairment.</p>

          <p><strong>Selection of Subjects.</strong> Fair procedures and outcomes in subject selection express justice requirements. Individual justice prohibits offering beneficial research exclusively to favored patients or selecting "undesirable" persons for risky research. Social justice requires consideration of which classes ought to participate based on their capacity to bear burdens, establishing preference orders (adults before children) and conditions for involving vulnerable populations (institutionalized mentally infirm, prisoners). Researchers must consider distributive justice patterns, ensuring already burdened populations are not systematically exploited while more advantaged populations receive the benefits.</p>

        <div class="card" id="significance">
          <h3 class="sub">Significance in Research Ethics</h3>
          <p>The Belmont Report established foundational ethical principles that continue to guide institutional review boards, researchers, and policymakers in evaluating and conducting human subjects research. Its framework provides analytical tools for resolving ethical problems, balancing competing ethical claims, and ensuring research advances knowledge while protecting human dignity and welfare.</p>
