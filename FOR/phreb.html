          <div class="sub">Overview</div>
          <p>The PHREB National Ethical Guidelines for Health and Health-Related Research (NEGHHR, 2017) is the official framework issued by the Philippine Health Research Ethics Board (PHREB) to ensure that all health and health-related research conducted in the Philippines is ethical, safe, and respectful of human dignity.</p>
          <p>The guidelines highlight the responsibilities of researchers, including obtaining valid and voluntary informed consent, safeguarding the rights of vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and indigenous peoples, and ensuring transparency in funding and potential conflicts of interest. They also stress the importance of securing approval from Research Ethics Committees (RECs) accredited by PHREB. These committees review protocols before implementation, monitor ongoing studies, and ensure that any modifications or adverse events are reported and addressed.</p>

            <li><strong>Researcher Responsibility:</strong> Researchers are accountable for ethical conduct and reporting results truthfully.</li>

          <h3 class="sub">Legal Basis & Scope</h3>
          <p>Issued by the Philippine Health Research Ethics Board (PHREB), the 2017 guidelines update earlier versions (2006, 2011) to address new challenges resulting from advances in science and technology, and cultural change. Under RA 10532 (The Philippine National Health Research System Act of 2013), these guidelines are required: all human health research must be guided by ethics, reviewed by accredited ethics committees, and follow these national guidelines.</p>

          <p>The scope covers biomedical and clinical research, health-related social science research, research on indigenous peoples, mental health, genetics, and the use of online/digital platforms. It also includes standards for biobanking, data protection, and emerging technologies.</p>
